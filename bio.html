  <h1>A Bit About Myself</h1>

  <!--  Add your letter to yourself, paragraph by paragraph  -->
  <p>
    Hello, I'm Sulaimon Okikiola Olanrewaju <i>(in full)</i>. I'm writing to you right now from Florida in the United States. As the Chief Executive Officer of the software development, website development, and data analytics business Keyventki Company Limited, I oversee all of these operations.
  </p>
  <p>
    The previous 10 years have been filled with dedication, perseverance, and passion combined with learning and earning.
  </p>
  <p>
    I completed my journey by earning a Master's in Data Science as well as a Computer Science degree from Kibo School. After working for three startups and four of the best IT corporations in the world, I decided to set up a business where my team and I create software to solve problems in real life.
  </p>
  <p>
    Even though I've faced many challenges in life, I've persevered because I want to avoid having to reflect on the past.
  </p>
  <p>
    Right now, I feel great because I can pay my bills without stress, help people in need as I see fit, and obtain anything I want whenever I want it without having to complain.
  </p>
  <p>
    I can only advise my present self the same encouragement I used to give it. ‘Keep going. You can do it!’
  </p>
